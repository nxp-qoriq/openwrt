Edgescale Quick Start

1. What's Edgescale
-------------------
EdgeScale is a unified, scalable, and secure device management solution
for Edge Computing applications. It enables OEMs and developers to
leverage cloud compute frameworks like AWS Greengrass, Azure IoT, and
Aliyun on Layerscape devices.

EdgeScale provides the missing piece of device security and management
needed for customers to securely deploy and manage many Edge computing
devices from the cloud. End-users and developers can use the EdgeScale
cloud dashboard to securely enroll Edge devices, monitor their health,
attest, and deploy container applications and firmware updates.

EdgeScale can also be used as a development environment to build
containers and generate firmware.

2. Supported features
---------------------
  * EdgeScale dashboard for users
  * Secure device enrolment
  * Secure key/certificate provisioning
  * OTA: firmware update
  * Device status monitoring on the cloud
  * Dynamic deployment of container-based applications

Note: OTA of Edgescale is currently not supported for OpenWrt.

3. Supported targets
--------------------
NXP Edgescale aims at not only NXP Layerscape targets. It could be
extended and deployed to any other targets easily even with different
architecture.

To support dynamic deployment of container-based applications, Edgescale
requires large free storage space in rootfs partition. So it's recommended
to use SD for rootfs storage.

Below are two Layerscape boards which had been verified.

  * LS1043ARDB SD card boot
  * LS1046ARDB SD card boot

4. Build
--------

Refer to OpenWrt documentation for build steps. In menuconfig stage, besides
the options required for target build in menuconfig, just select all options
in "Edgescale for edge computing".

* Target build options
Here is an example for LS1043ARDB SD card boot.

  +--------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Target System (NXP Layerscape)  --->                         |
  | Subtarget (ARMv8 64-bit based boards)  --->                  |
  | Target Profile (LS1043ARDB (SD Card Boot))  --->             |
  | Target Images  --->                                          |
  |   [*] ext4  --->                                             |
  |       (0)   Percentage of reserved blocks in root filesystem |
  |       Root filesystem block size (1k)  --->                  |
  |       [ ]   Create a journaling filesystem                   |
  |   (512) Root filesystem partition size (in MB)               |
  +--------------------------------------------------------------+

Note: Make sure enough space for rootfs. Here we use 512MB rootfs
partition on SD card. We could resized the partition to enlarge it 
online with fdisk/resize2fs in OpenWrt when Edgescale needs.

* Edgescale options

  | Network  --->                                  |

  |     [*]   Busybox support for Edgescale        |
  |     <*> edgescale-kubelet                      |
  |     [*]   Kernel support for Edgescale Kubelet |
  +------------------------------------------------+

5. Run Edgescale
----------------

After flashing OpenWrt firmware to SD card, please refer to "Getting Started"
chapter of Edgescale documentation (v0.5), for connecting to cloud and
deploying APP.
  - https://doc.edgescale.org/quickstart.html#

The only difference on OpenWrt are the steps in "Prepare Devices". After step 1
and step 2, just start up OpenWrt from SD card.
  1. Create Device
  2. Download & Provision Device Identity

And follow new steps below.
  3. Enlarge rootfs partition (See 7. Resizing partition log)

     - Delete origin rootfs partition, and create a new larger partition
       instead, with same start sector number.
       $ fdisk /dev/mmcblk0

     - Resize the partition
       $ resize2fs /dev/mmcblk0p1
     
  4. Connect WAN port to Internet

     - Check current WAN port and connect to Internet.
       $ uci get network.wan.ifname

     - If want to change WAN port for Internet accessing, use commands below.
       $ uci set network.wan.ifname=ethx
       $ uci set network.wan6.ifname=ethx
       $ /etc/init.d/network restart

     - Ping test.
       $ ping www.baidu.com

  5. Bringing the Device On-line

     Run Edgescale with below command, and refresh "My Devices" in Edgescale
     Dashboard showing the device as online.

     $ /etc/init.d/edgescale start

6. Known issues
---------------
NA
